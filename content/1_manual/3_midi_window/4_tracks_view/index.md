![tracks](images/midi-load-track.png)  
You can load a track that does not follow the chord progression in the song file. If the track contains chords that are used in the song file, though, the [improviser]() will use this chord information to create a harmonically correct solo!

This displays the current beat, the current tempo, and the {{< manualpage "5_effects" "transposition-window">}}current transposition that the improviser has found{{< /manualpage >}}, if this setting is on.
